## Overview of Analysis and Website Build
The purpose of this project is to take an already built webpage and dynamic table that shares recent UFO sighting data and make it more powerful. The way forward will be to provide users with the abilty to filter the data for multiple criteria and also to add table filters such as city, state, country and shape. 

This way, UFO affecionado's will be able to dig down and dive deep into the large pool of UFO sighting information we have bene able to collect.
