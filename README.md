[link to deployed webpage](https://titogithub123.github.io/UFOs/)

## Overview of Analysis and Website Build
The purpose of this project is to take an already built webpage and dynamic table that shares recent UFO sighting data and make it more powerful. The way forward will be to provide users with the abilty to filter the data for multiple criteria and also to add table filters such as city, state, country and shape. 

This way, UFO affecionado's will be able to dig down and dive deep into the large pool of UFO sighting information we have bene able to collect. 

## Results

As can be seen from the image below, we were able to successfully create an innovate and dynamic webpage that gives our users the capability of entering data on the left had side that corresponds to the distinct columns on our website's dataframe.

From here all we would need to do is input the criteria of interest into the search bars on the left hand side of the page to filter our data and return to our users only the data that fits their inquiry. 

For example, if a user wanted to filter the data for all UFO sightings that took place in the state of Florida and were a shpere in shape, they would simply input that request into the appropriate search fields and the website would retrieve and return that specific data. You can see this process in action in the screen shot below.
