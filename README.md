# UFO Sightings Investigation

[link to deployed webpage](https://titogithub123.github.io/UFOs/)

## Overview of Analysis and Website Build
The purpose of this project is to take an already built webpage and dynamic table that shares recent UFO sighting data and make it more powerful. The way forward will be to provide users with the abilty to filter the data for multiple criteria and also to add table filters such as city, state, country and shape. 

This way, UFO affecionado's will be able to dig down and dive deep into the large pool of UFO sighting information we have bene able to collect. 

## Results

As can be seen from the image below, we were able to successfully create an innovate and dynamic webpage that gives our users the capability of entering data on the left had side that corresponds to the distinct columns on our website's dataframe.

From here all we would need to do is input the criteria of interest into the search bars on the left hand side of the page to filter our data and return to our users only the data that fits their inquiry. 

For example, if a user wanted to filter the data for all UFO sightings that took place in the state of Florida and were a shpere in shape, they would simply input that request into the appropriate search fields and the website would retrieve and return that specific data. You can see this process in action in the screen shot below.

After our search was complete we would simply remove the items from the search bars, hit enter and our filtered data table would return to the original dimensions. 

## Summary

As a result of builiding this dyanmic website we learned some valuable lessons that can help us moving forward in our data science journey. One thing we did percive as a drawback to this particualr build that we may be able to incorporate into subsequent websites would be a "clear all" button to make getting back to the original data table a little easier.

Anytime we can remvove friction for our end users to use the tools we build and compltete their relevent search inquiries, we are helping them enjoy a smooth experience that will keep them coming back for more. 

In addition, one other search criteria field we could have added to the options was one for duration. As there are different duration lengths, some folks might have found it intriguing to be able to sort the data by how long the distinct duration for the sightings actually were. 

Lastly, another recommendation I would suggest for futher development of this website would be to add images of some of the vessels people say they have seen in the sky to give researchers a better of understanding of exaclty what it is folks are seeing in the nighttime sky.
